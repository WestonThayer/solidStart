# Solid Start

Are you a person that makes things for other people? Awesome, because this page is all about making things for people. There are 4 points of improvement here that are testable, fixable and improve usability for everybody.

## Four things to get started

### 1. Keyboard

Not everybody uses a mouse so you shouldn't test with only a mouse either. You are not building for you.
The most universal device to test with is a keyboard. `tab` should take you to every interactive element in a logical order. `shift+tab` should take you the opposite way. If you can reach **and** use every bit of functionality, you're off to a good start. You'll also want people to see which element has the focus I.E. which functionality can be controlled.

### 2. Contrast

Whatever you build has content, and content wants to be communicated. It's hard to communicate when content isn't visible to people. Contrast can help with this. 
There are many tools to measure contrast. Pick whichever you like from the resources. Each tool will give you a contrast ratio between a foreground and background color. For normal text (below 19px) this should be at least 4.5:1. For large text (at least 24px, or 19px and bold) it should be at least 3.0:1.
At least 3.0:1 also counts for interactive elements and focus like in 1. Keyboard. A user interface component or state should have a 3.0:1 contrast ratio against an adjacent color.

### 3. Alternatives

Ever tried to watch a movie in a full train, or listen to a podcast without headphones? When you can't perceive visually or auditively, a text alternative is rather nice to have!
Offer a text alternative for images. It should indicate the function of the image, the content or that it's decorative. Offer captions for video. Offer a transcript for podcasts.

### 4. Screen size

Compare a mobile phone to a tablet, a laptop or a PC. No screen is the same. Make sure that small screens offer the exact same content and functionality as the big ones.

## Inclusive Design

Congratulations! Follow these steps and you're helping all the people you're building for. This includes people with (temporary) disabilities. No, it's not exhaustive. There's lots more that you can. But you've already started. You're helping people!
